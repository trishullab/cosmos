Code for paper "Neurosymbolic Grounding for Compositional Generalization"

~We're currently removing PII tokens and cleaning up the repo! Code should be available _at worst_ beginning of November.~ This project is currently under review. We're going to wait until paper decisions (~Mid Jan) to do a full release. Feel free to contact me @ `atharvas@utexas.edu` with any questions!
